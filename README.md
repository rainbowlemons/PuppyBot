# PuppyBot
Puppybot is a recreation of an old discord bot that was in a friend's server.
This bot is designed to be a cute and fun addition to a server!
Using both the Discord API and Reddit API there are various fun commands for the bot.
I plan to add more commands in the future and to clean up the bot embed messages. 
I am open to suggestions.

## Features
- Fetch, Speak, and Pet commands to interact with the bot!
- Dog and Wholesome commands to post pictures from Reddit!
- A clean help menu
- Timed message sending to give more life to the server
